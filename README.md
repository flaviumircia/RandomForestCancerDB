Random Forest Cancer DataBase
My semester project for Artificial Intelligence, using Random Forest classification for predicting the type of cancer (Benign/Malign).
The database is Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset provided by "UCL Machine Learning Repository".
The program works with parameter hypertuning, modifying the in-bag and node-size (max_samples, max_features) for a total of 9 different variations(everytime printing the accuracy
specific for that variation)
